# Dependencies

- Python 2.7
- A c++11 compliant compiler that can be invoked with g++
- make

# Running

Make will handle pretty much everything, including building the c++
implementation of HMMs. Below are commands for three example runs with
different fields. `ns` specifies the namespace on DBpedia to which the property
belongs. This defaults to dbo. `property` is the name of the field on DBpedia.

```bash
make ns=dc property=description type=string
make property=deathYear type=date
make property=birthYear type=date
```
